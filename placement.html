                <h3>Internships:</h3>
                <p style="font-size: larger;">VIT-AP has numerous internship programs where students can learn about professional fields and get first-hand experience of the work environment even before they reach the actual placements. We work very closely with the industry counterparts and also have a network established with corporates and other universities across the globe that enable our students to gain the experience required for their respective job area while being interns.
                    To boost the placement opportunities VIT-AP has the final semester as the Cooperative Education Programme (co-op). Co-op provides students the opportunity to explore and refine their potential career path. The experience the student gains from this long internship period, narrows the gap with the industry, builds valuable industry connections, broaden their perspectives on the job front, and acquire the skills and knowledge required to face the professional world. This co-op makes them strong contenders ready for their job role.
                    Internships for students of VIT-AP made its way when our first batch of students completed their first academic year. Most of our students went in for internships during the summer break of 2018. This pattern has been continuing in a very positive manner, that now, students register for internships right from their first year of joining a programme at VIT-AP. In 2018, we had students doing international internships at Europe, Colombo, Bahrain and USA. Since then, we have almost all of our students’ doing internships in MNCs.</p>
                <h4>International Internships</h4>
